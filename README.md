# releasedashboard

Hi, we're just getting started, so there is nothing here yet.

We are building an open source [Release Dashboard](https://releasedashboard.com) (with commercial managed SaaS and on-premises support) 
so that software development teams can see all of their deployment, testing, and infrastructure change management events 
across all their products and environments.

If you're interested in learning more, bear with us, we're just getting started. 
But we plan on doing everything in the open -- development, collaboration, sales & marketing, whatever as we launch Release Dashboard.

Stay tuned...
